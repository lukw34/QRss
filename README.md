### What is it ?
QRss connect functionality from QR codes and RSS feed. With this application you are able to scan QR code and see all messages connected with it. Foremost you can subscribe one of board and afterwards receive push notifications of your phone. As an application user you can add message and create new boards. This simple application can be easily extended if you want to add new type of boards. I use React Native and Expo to create this application because this combination of tools gave possibility to debug and see changes really fast.
### How to start application ? 

Fist, you should install dependencies with yarn or npm
```bash
yarn
```

Afterwards you will be able to run this application with Expo.
```bash
yarn start
``` 

If you scan QR code with Expo application, you will be able to test QRss React Native mobile application.
